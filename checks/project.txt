The contemporary Court bears little resemblance to the third branch that John Jay feared “would not obtain the energy, weight and dignity” it needed to win the confidence of the American people and assume its proper role in the working of the national government. The Supreme Court’s power, of course, traces to both lifetime tenure of appointed judges and its exercise of the power of judicial review.  Today most Americans perceive the Supreme Court to be at least as powerful as the other two branches of the national government. Its decisions affect the operations of the other two branches of the national government and of the states, and they touch the rights and liberties of the people. What about limitations and checks on the exercise of judicial power? Are they adequate to keep the national judiciary in its proper constitutional place?  This segment first describes how the Constitution itself constrains federal judicial power. Then it turns to methods and examples of some of the ways in which Congress, the president, the states, and the people can check the exercise of judicial power. Some of the checks are institutional. They are part of the distinct American approach to separation of powers that James Madison described in Federalist No. 51, which gives the legislative and executive branches “constitutional means and personal motives” to resist judicial encroachment. The division of governing authority between the national government and the states means that states also have a role in controlling the federal judiciary. Finally, the people themselves have both direct and indirect ways to check the exercise of judicial power.

Courts cannot issue decisions simply because they choose to do so. Rather, they can issue decisions only in the context of lawsuits in which the proper parties participate and for which the appropriate conditions are present throughout the litigation. For example, if parties to a case decide to settle their dispute during the course of the litigation, they no longer have a “live” controversy and the Court therefore no longer has jurisdiction over the parties or the dispute.  Over the years, the Supreme Court and lower federal courts have adopted complex guidelines governing the “case” and “controversy” requirement. For example, parties must prove that they have “standing to sue,” which means they must have definite, concrete interests in the litigation and adverse legal positions. Parties must satisfy the standards that Congress sets for litigating civil and criminal cases in federal courts by demonstrating that they have a statutory or constitutional right to litigate in federal court. With rare exceptions, third parties cannot assert the rights of others. Failure to satisfy any of the elements required for legal standing to sue can result in dismissal of the case.

It ruled that the Cherokee Nation was a dependent nation, with a relationship to the United States like that of a “ward to its guardian,” not a “foreign state” in the sense contemplated by Article III, section 2 [Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831)]. (A year later, the Court changed course. In Worcester v. Georgia (1832), it held that the Cherokee Nation is a sovereign nation with standing to sue in federal courts.) More recently, the Court held that an environmental group lacked standing to represent the interests of the scenery, natural and historical objects, and the wildlife of the Mineral King Valley in California. The group had filed suit challenging a proposed recreational development in the area [Sierra Club v. Morton (1972)].  Another example of the case and controversy requirement relates to advisory opinions, which are non-binding interpretations of the law. In 1793, President George Washington asked the Supreme Court for 29 opinions on international law and neutrality related to the Franco-American Treaty of 1793. In a letter to the president, Chief Justice John Jay said that principles of separation of powers made it inappropriate for courts to give advisory opinions. The role of the courts was to decide lawsuits in cases properly before them. Although the constitutions of several states permit state courts to issue advisory opinions, the federal courts have never done so.

That is, a party does not have a right to sue in federal court. Rather, a party must prove that the United States Constitution or a federal statute confers power on a federal court to decide the case. Federal courts, for example, lack jurisdiction to grant divorces. A married person seeking to dissolve a marriage must file in the appropriate state court.   The Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction, under which it sits as a court of both first and last resort, is limited to cases involving ambassadors and suits involving states as parties. Congress has created a series of federal trial courts in each state, known as federal district courts, to exercise original or trial jurisdiction in other cases arising under the Constitution or federal law. Not all federal statutes give rise to federal court jurisdiction, however. The 2005 Detainee Treatment Act provides an example. It states that \"no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.”  The Supreme Court did not question the power of Congress to enact the statute. In 2006, however, the Court interpreted the statute to apply only to cases filed in the future, not to cases that already were pending in federal courts when the 2005 statute was enacted [Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006)].

The Supreme Court uses Rule 10 as a guide, not as an ironclad rule. Four justices must agree to allow a case for review. In 2012-13, the Court was asked to review 7,508 of more than a million cases decided by federal courts and top state courts throughout the United States. (The Court had only one petition under its original jurisdiction.) The Court allowed review in 77 cases, leading to written opinions in 73 cases. Most of the decisions did not require the Court to interpret the United States Constitution. The few constitutional decisions that did emerge, however, were noteworthy. For example, it decided two cases involving the use of police dogs in drug searches. In Florida v. Harris (2103), the Court held that a drug-detection dog can give police probable cause to conduct a search without a warrant for drugs inside a vehicle that is detained during a routine traffic stop.

All federal court judges serve during terms of good behavior. They can demonstrate considerable independence in their responses to Supreme Court decisions when applying the rules from Supreme Court decisions to the facts of cases that subsequently come to the lower courts. Sometimes lower federal courts disagree with Supreme Court holdings and refuse to follow them. Their disagreement may be a factor in persuading the Supreme Court to reconsider a holding, overrule it, or modify it.  Affirmative action, a policy of awarding positions to groups that previously have suffered from discrimination, provides an example of the interaction among federal courts on questions of constitutional interpretation. In 1978, in Regents of California v. Bakke, the Supreme Court held that, in some circumstances, public universities may take race into account in making admissions decisions. It held that doing so does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, so long as universities do not set racial quotas in making those decisions. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit disagreed with the Supreme Court. In Hopwood v. Texas (1996), the Fifth Circuit held that the University of Texas law school “may not use race as a factor” in making admissions decisions. Thereafter, a federal district court in Michigan also held that considerations of race in law school admissions are unlawful.

But it added: “The Court takes the Law School at its word that it would like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula and will terminate its use of racial preferences as soon as practicable. The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.” Grutter had the effect of nullifying Hopwood. Ten years later, the Supreme Court imposed an even more rigorous standard for evaluating race-based admissions standards: consideration of race in undergraduate admissions decisions is presumed to be unconstitutional and will be subjected to the strictest judicial scrutiny [Fisher v. University of Texas (2013)].  Lower federal courts played an important role in keeping the controversy over race-based admissions programs on the Supreme Court’s agenda. Meanwhile, changes in the make-up of Supreme Court between 1978 and 2013 resulted in different perspectives on the requirements of the 14th Amendment in the context of college admissions policies.

In 1927, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes described the decision as a “self-inflicted wound” that almost destroyed the Supreme Court as an institution.

For many years thereafter, Congress by law identified the categories of cases that either qualified for appeal to the Supreme Court or that required Supreme Court review.  In 1925, Congress dramatically expanded the authority of the Supreme Court to decide for itself which cases it will review. The process is known as “certiorari.” A litigant who has not prevailed before a federal court of appeals or highest state court can submit a petition to the Supreme Court asked it to issue a writ of certiorari, which orders the lower court to send the record of the case to the Supreme Court for its review.  In 1988, Congress eliminated virtually all categories of appeals, thereby giving the Supreme Court almost complete discretion to decide which cases it will hear through certiorari process. Current Supreme Court rules require four of the nine justices to agree to “allow cert.” Deciding which cases to decide now is one of the most important responsibilities of the Supreme Court. Typically, the Court allows review in fewer than 2% of the petitions for certiorari it receives each year. In early 2015, after allowing conflicts to develop among the federal circuit courts, it allowed review in a case to decide whether the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment prohibits states from denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

That law gave the Department of Justice the power (and money) to bring lawsuits against school districts that failed to comply with Brown v. Board of Education (1954) and subsequent decisions about implementation of Brown. One section of the act provided that federal education funds would not be given to public school districts that refused to comply with the Court’s desegregation orders.

The decisions also influenced congressional bills to facilitate creation of private charter schools. After the decision in Roe v. Wade (1973), recognizing the right of a woman to terminate her pregnancy during the first trimester, Congress enacted laws that prohibited the use of Medicaid and other federal funds to pay for abortions except when the life of a pregnant woman would be endangered by carrying the pregnancy to term.

As a tool for overseeing and controlling the power that it has delegated to executive agencies, Congress devised a scheme requiring agencies to submit their proposed rules to one or both houses of Congress or to particular congressional committees for their approval or rejection before the rule went into effect. The practice of disapproving proposed rules became known as the “legislative veto.” Decisions to reject proposed rules were not submitted to the president for his veto or signature.

Between 1862 and 1869, however, its choice to increase the size of the Court appeared to be a blatant attempt to give President Lincoln an opportunity to give the Court a pro-Union slant, while its decision to reduce the size of the Court appeared to be a similarly blatant attempt to prevent President Andrew Johnson from making an appointment.  Only once has a president taken the lead in proposing changes in the size of the Supreme Court. In 1937, President Franklin Roosevelt became so frustrated with Supreme Court decisions invalidating his New Deal programs that he advocated increasing by one the number of justices on the Court for every justice who refused to take senior status at age 70. He couched the proposal as an effort to help the Court handle its crowded dockets without further overburdening its elderly justices. No one was fooled.    Vice President John Nance Garner withdrew his support for what quickly became known as Roosevelt’s “court-packing plan.” He informed the president that he could not advocate for the measure in his capacity as president of the Senate. Although the Senate at the time was dominated by Democrats, most members of the Judiciary Committee also disapproved of the president’s blatantly political attempt to control the Supreme Court. Public support lagged as well. Roosevelt’s court-packing plan boomeranged: it had the effect of insulating the judiciary from partisan attacks by the other branches and of bolstering judicial independence.

Furman effectively nullified death penalty laws in all states that recognized capital punishment. States immediately began revising their death penalty statutes. The Court lifted the moratorium four years later in Gregg v. Georgia (1976). It held that capital punishment does not violate the 8th Amendment so long as the sentencing authority (judge or jury) is given “the information relevant to the imposition of sentence and provided with standards to guide its use of the information.”   In Reynolds v.

The Court’s reapportionment rulings drew firestorms of protest, and calls for constitutional amendments. Eventually, however, states brought their constitutions into compliance and calls for constitutional amendments waned.  States also have defied Supreme Court decisions. A famous example is Georgia’s refusal to recognize exclusive federal authority over American Indian tribes in Worcester v. Georgia (1832).

Raich (2005), the Supreme Court held that the authority of Congress to prohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana for medical purposes trumps state laws allowing such use.    After the decision, Attorneys General in the ten states whose laws permitted the use of marijuana for medical purposes advised state agencies charged with administering medical marijuana programs to continue those programs. California’s Attorney General, for example, said, “Californians spoke overwhelmingly in favor of medical marijuana by passing . . . the Compassionate Use Initiative, and that law still stands in our state.” Today, more than half of the states have medical marijuana laws and several others, as well as the District of Columbia, have enacted laws permitting the recreational use of marijuana.

Contentious Supreme Court decisions frequently motivate constituents to contact their elected representatives requesting them to take some action in response. One recent example of constituent response to a Supreme Court decision is in the area of campaign finance. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), the Supreme Court held that limitations Congress imposed on the amount that unions and corporations can contribute to political campaigns violate the 1st Amendment. The opinion was unpopular across the political spectrum. Four years later, in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission (2014) the Court held that aggregate limits an individual may contribute in a two-year campaign cycle also violate the 1st Amendment.   The Court’s decisions in these cases galvanized those who seek to limit the influence of “big money” in American politics and to restore to Congress the power to regulate campaign finance. Some have pushed for legislation requiring candidates to disclose the amount and sources of their campaign contributions. Citizens United stated that disclosure statutes would not violate the 1st Amendment. In addition, more than 14 proposals for constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress, many at the request of constituents, to overturn Citizens United and McCutcheon.

There is no clear answer and probably no real way to know. However, American history demonstrates that Supreme Court decisions that are badly out of step with the majority of the American people have little chance of being implemented successfully.  Recent public opinions polls reveal that public confidence in the American political system is at an all-time low. However, Americans seem to have more confidence in the third branch than they do in Congress or the president. In June 2014, for example, a Gallup Poll revealed that 39% of Americans have confidence in the Supreme Court as an institution, while only 29% have confidence in the president, and a mere 7% have confidence in Congress. These numbers may help explain why so many Americans turn to litigation rather than legislation to address problems that raise larger questions of public policy.

They voiced various concerns. Brutus predicted that the Supreme Court would exercise its power to “melt the states into one entire govenrment.” James Madison worried that the Court would encroach improperly on the powers of Congress. Thomas Jefferson believed that the national judiciary was “the most dangerous branch.” Alexander Hamilton argued that the federal judiciary always would be “the last dangerous branch” because it “has no influence over either the sword or the purse.” John Jay fretted the Supreme Court was so defective that it would not achieve “the energy, weight and dignity” required to be a co-equal branch of the national government or earn public respect and confidence.  Without question, judicial review and lifetime appointments have contributed to the institutional power of the United States Supreme Court and lower federal courts. The nation’s first Chief Justice would not recognize the institution from which he resigned and to which he declined to be reappointed. However, the federal judiciary has not “melted down the states” as Brutus feared. The states remain vibrant actors in the American political system as demonstrated, in part, by their responses to Supreme Court decisions and their role in confirming judicial nominees. Congress and the president continue to have immense constitutional and political powers over the federal judiciary, as well as complete power over whether and how to exercise those powers.

Disagreements over the appropriate role of the federal judiciary are as contentious now as they were during the founding period. As passionate as those debates may be and probably will remain, however, the insight provided by Alexis de Tocqueville should not be forgotten: the power of the Supreme Court may be immense, “but it is a power of opinion.” People must consent to obey the law.
