An additional reason that ratification might not be easy came to light during the Pennsylvania ratifying convention. That convention voted to approve the Constitution on December 12, 1787, by a vote of 46-23.  Those who voted against ratification were irked when the majority refused to send their objections to Congress for its consideration. The Pennsylvania Minority, as it came to be known, took out newspaper ads in other states explaining their reasons for opposing the Constitution. The Pennsylvania Minority became part of the cry for a bill of rights and other constitutional amendments.

Brutus contrasted the powers of English judges with those of federal judges under the proposed Constitution.  He argued that no matter how powerful English judges were, they were less dangerous than American federal judges would be because they were “under the control of the legislative.” By contrast, “the judges under this constitution will control the legislature.” That was so, he predicted, because federal judges, and ultimately the Supreme Court, would have the final say about the meaning of the Constitution:    The supreme court then have a right, independent of the legislature, to give a construction to the constitution and every part of it, and there is no power provided in this system to correct their construction or do it away. If therefore, the legislatures pass any laws, inconsistent with the sense of the judges put upon the constitution, they will declare it void; and therefore in this respect their power is superior to that of the legislature.

In No. 15, Brutus accused the drafters of the Constitution of conceiving the national judicial power to “facilitate the abolition of the state governments” through interpretation of the Constitution.

They circulated petitions urging that the Constitution be adopted as quickly as possible. Political heavyweights such as Benjamin Franklin, James Wilson, Alexander Hamilton, Robert Livingston, James Madison, John Jay, Rufus King, John Marshall, and Francis Dana spoke passionately in defense of the Constitution. Some supporters also wrote essays urging ratification, using pen names.  They included Letters from a Landholder (Connecticut’s Oliver Ellsworth),  Alfredus (New Hampshire’s Samuel Tenny), Marcus (North Carolina’s James Iredell), and Aristides (probably Maryland’s Alexander Contee Hanson).  The idea to mount both a systematic, detailed defense of the Constitution and a response to its opponents came from Alexander Hamilton. A series of 85 essays advocating ratification were published in various New York newspapers under the pseudonym Publius between October 1787 and August 1788. (Hamilton probably wrote 51 of the essays; James Madison, probably 26; John Jay, probably 5; and Hamilton and Madison probably collaborated on between 8 and 20.) Only 24 of the essays appeared in newspapers outside New York during the ratification controversy.

Neither, he argued, was it practical to repeatedly refer claims that one branch had overstepped its bounds for decision by the people.

The answer is that, when the Constitution went into effect, two of the four states that still had not ratified were crucial to the success of the new national government: Virginia (the state with the greatest population and territory, including what is now West Virginia and Kentucky) and New York (a state with huge commercial clout).

Gerry pledged to fight for a bill of rights that would, among other things, place limits on the powers of the federal courts. Richard Henry Lee (of Federal Farmer fame) permitted his name to be placed before the Virginia legislature to be named to the Senate. Lee worked tirelessly to assure that the law organizing the federal judiciary would constrain the federal courts and limit the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
