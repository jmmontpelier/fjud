They anticipated that their appointees would bring a different constitutional perspective to the Court, and they were correct. Marshall in his later years had a choice: he could moderate his previously sweeping statements about national power, property rights, and constitutional limitations on the states for the sake of maintaining institutional unity. Or he could express his own views forcefully through dissents in constitutional cases with which he disagreed. Marshall generally chose the course of moderation. He dissented in only one constitutional case during his entire career on the Court, toward the end of his service. That case was Ogden v. Saunders (1827).

The case involved a challenge to a state’s power under the so-called Takings Clause of the 5th Amendment.  John Barron and John Craig had owned a highly profitable wharf on the Patapsco River in Baltimore, Maryland.  When they built the wharf, it was in the deepest water in the harbor, making it easily accessible by a variety of water vessels. Between 1815 and 1821, Baltimore city officials, exercising power delegated by the State of Maryland, authorized a series of public works projects that included paving several Baltimore streets and diverting into the harbor streams that flowed from the hills bordering the city. During rainy seasons, large quantities of sand and dirt were deposited into the water in front of Barron and Craig’s wharf. The water became so shallow that water vessels could no longer use the wharf.    By 1822, Craig was dead and Barron was left with a wharf that for all practical purposes was worthless. The city acknowledged that its public works projects had ruined Barron’s business, but it offered no compensation. It justified its actions as the exercise of a state’s power to protect the health of the city, a right it retained under the 10th Amendment to the Constitution. Barron sued the mayor and the city council of Baltimore for taking his property without just compensation, in violation of the 5th Amendment. The Baltimore County Court awarded Barron monetary damages, but the state’s highest court reversed that award. Barron sought a writ of error from the United States Supreme Court.

The Federalist Party fell into disarray after it lost popular support because of its opposition to the War of 1812. The party’s emphasis on a strong national government promoting private commercial rights could not withstand the forces of populism associated with Jacksonian democracy. The country had also more than doubled in size, adding immense geographic territories acquired from France, Spain, and Mexico. Its population had more than tripled. Confrontations with American Indians had led to their being “removed” to reservations to make more land available for predominately white settlers. Great sectional divides had emerged over slavery, sparked both by moral opposition and advances in technology. The cotton gin, for example, dramatically sped up the process of removing seeds from cotton fiber.  That in turn increased the demand for cotton. Southern plantation owners needed more land and claimed that they needed more slaves to meet that demand. All these changes had political consequences and raised questions about constitutional interpretation.  Marshall’s successor, Roger Taney, disagreed with Marshall on fundamental questions about the meaning of the United States Constitution and the nature of the union it had created. However, Taney and his colleagues never questioned the Supreme Court’s power of judicial review or its status as a major player in the momentous decisions the country was facing.

He promised an administration that would serve the common people. One of his first acts was to call for a congressional investigation of the Second Bank of the United States, which he contended favored the interests of urban, manufacturing elites over exploration and expansion of the western frontier by the common man. Congress investigated the bank, but it did not agree with the president. Jackson remained convinced that the bank should be shut down. In 1831, he tapped then Maryland Attorney General Roger Taney to be his Attorney General. Taney’s assignment was to help dismantle the Second Bank of the United States.  Taney joined a court that already was in the process of retreat from the high-water mark of Marshall Court decisions that had used the Contracts Clause in Article I, section10, to protect the rights of vested economic elites against regulation by state legislatures. Jacksonian populists contended that legislatures (state and federal) had the power to regulate the economy in the public interest. Economic elites should not be allowed to stifle change by taking refuge in vested rights and contract rights. Even John Marshall had seemed to bow to the forces of Jacksonian democracy, writing in l830 that state-chartered banks are not exempt from state taxation unless their charters explicitly free them from such obligations [Providence Bank v. Billings (1830)].      In his very first term as Chief Justice, Taney had the opportunity to take the Court further in the direction of upholding state regulatory powers against claims of vested property rights. The case in question had roots deep in American history as well as ties to the country’s modernizing economy.

In 1785, the Massachusetts legislature incorporated the Charles River Bridge Company to build a toll bridge between Charlestown and Boston.

The company did a thriving business, collecting more and more tolls as traffic between Boston and Charlestown increased.  In 1828, the Massachusetts legislature responded to increasing urban congestion in the Boston area by incorporating the Warren Bridge Company to build a second bridge connecting Boston and Charlestown. The new bridge was to be virtually parallel to the Charles River Bridge. The charter to the Warren Bridge Company provided that its bridge would operate as a toll bridge until 1834.

The charter of the Warren Bridge Company, it argued, impaired the contract with the Charles River Bridge Company.  The Warren Bridge was built and in use by the time the Suffolk County Court ruled on the dispute. The Charles River Bridge Company therefore amended its complaint, seeking reimbursement for tolls that had been diverted to the Warren Bridge. It also sought an injunction against the Warren Bridge ever being operated as a free bridge.  The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled against the Charles River Bridge Company on all its claims. The Charles River Bridge Company sought Supreme Court review. The case had to be argued twice, because illnesses and vacancies on the Court made it impossible to muster a majority until 1837. By then, the Warren River Bridge had become the property of the state and was being operated as a free bridge. The Charles River Bridge had closed, and the Supreme Court was dominated by appointees sympathetic to the rights of states to regulate private property.

The policy of having one Supreme Court justice serve on each of the federal circuit courts justified a corresponding increase in the size of the Supreme Court from seven to nine. President Jackson’s successor, Martin VanBuren, appointed two advocates of states’ rights: Tennessee’s John Catron, and Kentucky’s John McKinley. McKinley served only until 1852; he was replaced by another advocate of states’ rights, Alabama’s John Campbell. These justices helped to form a new majority on the Supreme Court that viewed both the states and the national government as having broad regulatory powers. Instead of the national government dominating the states, however, their approach to constitutional interpretation recognized the national and state governments as having concurrent authority to regulate commerce and other matters. This view of the Constitution would have a significant impact on commercial regulation.   Three notable examples of cases validating state regulatory powers during this period are: New York v. Miln (1837), License Cases (1847), and Cooley v. Board of Wardens (1852).  In each instance, the Taney Court took a different approach to interpreting the Constitution than would have been anticipated from the earlier days of the Marshall Court. But the Court’s authority to interpret the Constitution and to speak with an authoritative institutional voice was no longer in question.

Delegates to the Constitutional Convention were forced to make major compromises on representation, taxation, and the importation of slaves in an attempt to reconcile the divergent economic and social interests that had developed throughout the colonial period and after the Revolution. The slavery compromises were among the most significant.  The Three-fifths Compromise in Article I, section, 2, dealt with representation and taxation. It provided that three-fifths “of all other Persons” would be counted when apportioning congressional representation in the House of Representatives and for levying direct taxes. That compromise meant that slave-holding states would not have as much representation in the House as their population otherwise would have permitted had each slave been counted as a whole person, but more representation in Congress than abolitionists had hoped they would have. Article I, section 9, barred Congress from prohibiting the “importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit” until 1808. That compromise allowed the slave trade to continue, but limited its likely duration. Article I, section 8, authorized Congress to regulate commerce among the several states, but Article I, section 9, prohibited it from imposing taxes or duties on articles exported from any state. Without that provision, Congress might have imposed indirect taxes on products produced by the labor of enslaved persons, thereby taxing the institution out of existence.

One of the five statutes, the Organic Act of 1850 that created the Utah and New Mexico territories, also contained a provision that made it easier for parties to advance slavery questions to the Supreme Court. The section that created courts for the new territories gave litigants the right to take appeals from the top territorial court to the United States Supreme Court in civil cases in which the amount in controversy exceeded $1,000.

The reduction was to be accomplished through deaths and resignations. The result was that Johnson was prevented from making any Supreme Court nominations during his presidency, and the influence of southerners on the Court was reduced. Three years later, in 1869, after Johnson was out of office, Congress increased the size of the Supreme Court to nine, giving Republican Ulysses Grant several opportunities to nominate justices. That year, the Court also issued its first opinion about the nature of American federalism in the wake of the Civil War. The case, Texas v.

These areas, in turn had been embroiled in the divisive issue of slavery in the territories. Texas officials agreed to compromise on the location of the state’s borders in return for the United States assuming some $10 million of the state’s indebtedness. As part of that settlement, the United States issued $5 million worth of gold indemnity bonds, payable by 1864 to the State of Texas or bearer, at a rate of 5% interest. The Texas legislature passed a statute requiring the governor to sign the bonds before they could be sold. Most of the bonds were sold and contained the signature of Governor G.W. Pashal. But some were still in the Texas treasury when the Civil War broke out.   Texas seceded from the Union in 1861. In 1862, the confederate legislature authorized the sale of up to $1 million of the gold bonds that remained in the Texas treasury to help defray the cost of the war. The confederate legislature authorized the Texas Military Board to give the gold bonds to George White and John Chiles in return for their promise to deliver medical supplies and other goods to aid the Confederacy. Governor Pashal’s signature was not on those bonds.   White and Chiles did not uphold their end of the bargain, claiming that a group of disbanded soldiers had looted the supplies and goods that they had assembled before they could be delivered.

Consistent with that view, in Williams v. Mississippi (1898), the Court upheld a state law that required voters to pay poll taxes and pass literacy tests in order to vote. Then in James v. Bowman (1903), the Court denied the federal government authority to prosecute a private citizen who by bribery had prevented blacks from voting in a congressional election in Kentucky.

Articles I and II provide that members of Congress and the president must be United States citizens. Article IV guarantees to citizens of each state the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states. However, the Constitution of 1789 did not define citizenship. The first sentence of the 14th Amendment provided a definition for the first time in 1868: all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction are citizens of the United States and of the states within which they reside. The effect of this definition was to overturn Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857). Disputes over citizenship persisted, however. In Elk v. Wilkins (1884), for example, the Court ruled that Native Americans who were born in the United States were not automatically United States citizens, because their tribal status meant that they were not entirely subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. (The Snyder Act of 1924 conferred citizenship on American Indians, thereby nullifying Elk.) The Citizenship Clause also did not resolve questions about the relationship between citizenship and the right to vote. In Minor v. Happersett (1875), the Court held that woman who were citizens did not have the right to vote. (That decision was overturned by the 19th Amendment in 1920.)  Federal courts also have held that the Citizenship Clause refers to only natural, not artificial persons. Corporations, for example, are examples of artificial persons. Corporations are not entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens guaranteed in either Article IV [Paul v. Virginia (1869)] or the 14th Amendment [Insurance Co. v.

Whatever might have been the intent of the drafters of the Privileges or Immunities Clause in the 14th Amendment, the Supreme Court, in the first case brought under the provision, rendered it a practical nullity.

Despite efforts by various groups to have the Supreme Court breathe new life into the Privileges or Immunities Clause—including contemporary claims that the clause was intended to protect fundamental rights such as liberty of contract and the right to carry guns—the Court has continued to ignore the clause and focus instead on fundamental rights under the due process clauses.

It relates to fairness and prohibiting government from wrongfully depriving persons of their interests. Beyond that general definition, the concept is elusive and has led to extensive litigation, not always with clear or lasting answers.  One issue has involved the definition of the terms used in the Due Process Clause. For example, with respect to the reference to life, questions have arisen about when it begins and when it ends. Is an unborn child a person? Is a person dead and therefore no longer entitled to the protections of due process when the heart stops beating or when certain brain functioning ceases? Does liberty mean more than freedom from physical restraints? Does liberty include the right to enter into contracts without the interference of governmental regulation? Does the concept of liberty embody privacy? Does property include both real and personal property? Does it extend to intangibles such as reputation and ideas? When does a governmental regulation of property cross the line and becoming a “taking” of property for which just compensation is due?

That decision ushered in a new era of equal protection analysis and a series of cases challenging public school desegregation efforts.

He had on his side the unambiguous words of the 5th Amendment: “[N]or shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” The Supreme Court previously had held that it had jurisdiction under Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 over all cases arising under the Constitution. The 5th Amendment is part of the Constitution. Moreover, in the past, the Marshall Court had held that the Constitution protects vested property rights and limits the exercise of state powers.    In a unanimous opinion, Marshall wrote that the Supreme Court could not review the decision of the Maryland high court because the 5th Amendment limits only the national government. It does not limit the states. The national government played no role in the destruction of Barron’s wharf. According to Marshall, a litigant claiming that the action of a state infringes on rights or liberties must look to the state’s constitution, not to the United States Constitution, for a remedy.    Barron v. Baltimore (1831) established the proposition that the Bill of Rights limits only the actions of the national government. The rights in the Bill of Rights do not protect individuals from the actions of statement governments. The Barron decision opened the door to an interpretation of the Constitution considerably different from the one Marshall had provided in cases like McCulloch v. Maryland (1819).
