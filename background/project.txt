Rather, individuals live on their own, in a state of freedom and equality.  Further, Locke argued,  The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions. . .  Because everyone is free and equal in the state of nature, everyone has the right to determine whether others have violated the law of nature and to punish those who do. In Locke’s words, “every man hath a right to punish the offender, and be executioner of the law of nature.” In the state of nature, there is no “common superior” to act as judge.

The lack of a “known and indifferent judge” in the state of nature, “with authority to determine all differences according to the established law,” leaves everyone both to judge and to carry out punishments for violations of the law of nature. The right and power to do so, however, result in the state of war that drives human beings out of the state of nature and into an agreement to enter into civil society.    In other words, the right and power of every individual to be his or her own judge in deciding whether someone else has acted contrary to reason is one of the reasons why living in a state of nature is not possible.  Individuals must abandon the state of nature and enter into civil society in order to enjoy peace, security, and protection of property. In leaving the state of nature, everyone gives up the power “to do whatsoever he thinks fit for the preservation of himself, and others within the permission of the law of nature.” Everyone also gives up the power to punish offenses against the law of nature.

He also explained why judging is one of the important functions of government.  However, Locke did not contend that judging must be separated from other governmental functions. To the contrary, he described the activities of judging and executing the laws as being closely related. Neither did Locke contend that social contract theory necessarily supports republican government. Indeed, he suggested that social contract theory can be compatible with various forms of government, including a limited monarchy.  Many of the ideas in Locke’s Second Treatise about the legitimate foundations of government were revolutionary and hence considered dangerous. Social contract theory, after all, undermined the theory of the divine right of kings. The Second Treatise was published anonymously in 1690, and Locke never claimed authorship. (Laslett edition). By the mid-18th century, however, Lockean principles were part of the mix in the groundbreaking thinking about government taking place in the North American colonies.

England is known as a common-law system of justice. A simple definition of the common law is “the judge-made rules that emerge from decisions in individual cases.” Those rules embody a country’s customs, traditions, reasoning, and logic. The common law presumes that judges have the power to make law in the absence of legislatively enacted statutes (such as defining various crimes and the elements of those crimes), as well as the power to interpret the meaning of statutes that legislatures do enact. Once rules are established, judges as well as others are expected to follow them. Hence, previous decisions establish the foundation for the next case, reflecting the principle that judges and the law should treat litigants the same. The legal phrase for reliance on precedents from the past to decide current conflicts is known as stare decisis (literally translated as “let the decision stand”). However, when common-law judges encounter a case for which previous rulings are not satisfactory because of changed circumstances, or because those rulings no longer are deemed reasonable, they have authority to modify the holdings of the past.  Although it is not static, it tends to evolve slowly.     This simple description of the common law belies its vast complexity in operation. Before the Norman Invasion of 1066, England had been highly decentralized and that decentralization was reflected in a specialized set of courts that served a variety of needs, from merchants and church courts to manorial, county, and royal courts.

Equity refers to the power of judges to base decisions on principles of fairness and justice in situations in which rigid application of the rules of common law would be too harsh.    For centuries, legal scholars compiled treatises summarizing the rules and intricacies of the law as it had evolved in England.

Like Locke, Montesquieu published his work anonymously because his ideas, too, were considered radical.  Montesquieu joined Blackstone in focusing on the requirements for political liberty. Political liberty required devising ways to prevent the abuse of governmental power. How, he asked, can government be organized so that “no man need be afraid of another”? His response was that government be constituted so that “no man shall be compelled to things to which the law does not oblige him, nor forced to abstain from things which the law permits.” How a particular government is best constituted to achieve this goal, he argued, depended in large part on the social, economic, and geographic conditions of the society.

Some states, like New York and Delaware, established separate courts of law and equity. Other states, like, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, vested their courts with both legal and equitable powers.

All early state constitutions also assured at least some level of judicial independence by creating terms of “good behavior” for judges and salary guarantees.  As the above examples demonstrate, the states took considerably different approaches to judicial involvement in the work of the legislative and the executive. Virginia demanded a rigorous separation of powers and prohibited branches from exercising powers “properly” belonging to another branch. New York gave the judges of both law and equity courts a say in proposed legislation through its council of revision.

Early in their deliberations the delegates agreed that the new national government should have one Supreme Court and one or more inferior courts, but they disagreed over whether the Constitution should describe the organization and jurisdiction of the inferior courts. The longest debate was over the council of revision proposed in the Virginia Plan. Those opposed to such a council argued that it violated separation of powers; that judicial participation in the formation of policy would undermine judges’ credibility and neutrality when they subsequently decided cases involving laws that had been before the council; and that judges should not issue advisory opinions.

Though he often takes a back seat to Locke, Montesquieu, and Rousseau, he was one of the first to conceive of a social contract, and the first notable philosopher to recognize and advocate for written fundamental law, leading many scholars to argue that Thomas Hobbes' \"civil philosophy\" held great sway over the thinking of the American founding generation. They embraced his theory for how government was properly founded and acquired—the basic notion of a social contract. Hobbes is often remembered for his preference for monarchy, but in reality, his political philosophy was not limited to monarchy, contenting rather than sovereign authority, what ever form it took after the consent of the people, be absolute. The Constitution and its mode of ratification provided the embodiment of that consent in the United States.   Implicit in Hobbes' theory was the idea that the thoughts and idea of private individuals could not be reliably tempered by reason or reflection, but that governmental institutions, by the way they are constructed, can elevate the collective. This idea is given expression in Madison's Federalist 10—which explained how the private ideas of individuals or factions would be tempered through the way the Constitution was constructed.
