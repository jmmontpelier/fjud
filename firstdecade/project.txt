Some members of that committee had been delegates to the Constitutional Convention; several had participated in state ratifying conventions. Senator Oliver Ellsworth was elected to chair the committee.    Ellsworth, a lawyer, had been the Connecticut delegate to the Constitutional Convention who proposed the so-called Connecticut Compromise to resolve the disagreement between the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan over representation in Congress. That compromise resulted in representation of the population in the House of Representatives and representation of the states in the Senate. Ellsworth had helped to assure that the states would have a powerful voice in the new national government, and he undoubtedly understood that the states would have strong opinions about the structure and powers of the federal courts. Ellsworth was the primary drafter of “An Act to establish the Judicial Courts of the United States,” commonly known as the Judiciary Act of 1789. He apparently consulted closely with New Jersey Senator William Paterson (author of the New Jersey Plan at the Constitutional Convention).     Ellsworth’s outline for the national judiciary, which he presented in May 1789, set the size of the Supreme Court at six and recommended creation of two levels of inferior courts, district and circuit. It gave the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction over decisions of top state courts involving questions of federal law. It also recommended an administrative infrastructure to serve the federal courts.

Some members of Congress, for example,wanted no system of lower federal courts at all. They trusted state courts to decide all cases involving federal law. Other members favored creation of federal district courts, but argued that the jurisdiction of those courts should be limited to admiralty and maritime cases. Yet other members urged the creation of a system of powerful federal courts with jurisdiction as broad as the Constitution would allow. Like the delegates to the Constitutional Convention, members of the first Congress would have to agree to compromises about the judiciary.  The most heated congressional debates focused on federal court jurisdiction over controversies involving states, states and citizens of other states, and citizens of different states. Some believed that out-of-state litigants would not be able to get a fair hearing in state courts. Others argued that  local “prejudices” would persist among states to protect their unique systems of justice.

Several states had conditioned ratification of the Constitution on the introduction of such a bill into the First Congress. Among the list of demands for inclusion in a bill of rights were provisions to guarantee a fair trial to defendants in federal criminal cases, assurances that no facts found by a jury could be retried on appeal, and the guarantee of jury trials in civil cases. Guaranteeing limits on federal court powers in a bill of rights had the potential to defuse some opposition to the judiciary bill. Eventually, the House decided to vote on proposed amendments to the Constitution before completing its deliberations on the judiciary bill. That decision proved to be strategically wise, because it provided a basis for compromise on various provisions in the judiciary bill.

Moreover, when the Supreme Court did begin to issue decisions from cases on its own docket, the justices again chose to remain in the shadow of common-law traditions, just as they did when they looked to Courts of King’s Bench and Chancery as a guide for their internal practices: they followed the centuries old English judicial practice of announcing their opinions seriatim. That is, each justice, in order of seniority, explained his understanding of the facts and the proper resolution of the case. The seriatim method of announcing opinions means that there is no controlling opinion of the court. Cases do not announce broader legal principles or legal doctrines. The seriatim method of announcing opinions encouraged each Justice to think and write independently of his colleagues. There was little need to confer and debate about the proper resolution of cases, or to collaborate and even compromise on opinions to give them the added heft of being the opinion of the court. Moreover the Supreme Court had no official way to report its opinions. Individual opinions appeared in newspapers, but the decisions of the court were not reported systematically.

Then, claiming that West had failed to pay the debt, Barnes sought to eject West from the property that secured the debt. Before the circuit court, West argued that he had satisfied his obligations to Barnes, pointing to the Rhode Island statute that permitted payment with paper money. The circuit court (Justices Jay and Cushing sitting with a district court judge) held against West in Barnes’ claim for ejectment. West sought review by the Supreme Court, looking to it to validate the Rhode Island statute.

The Judiciary Act called for the Supreme Court to issue writs of error (orders to lower courts to send the records of cases for review).  West had convinced the circuit court to issue the writ, so that he would not have to travel to Washington to file a petition asking the Supreme Court itself to do so.  In seriatim opinions, the justices wrote that West had not followed the strict requirement for writs of error under Section 23 of the Judiciary Act.  They declared his writ of error invalid and dismissed his appeal.    Some of the justices lamented the unfairness of the requirements for the writ of error process contained in the Judiciary Act, particularly the hardship that it imposed on litigants who were not wealthy or who lived far from Washington.  But, they said, Congress, not the Supreme Court, was responsible for correcting the procedural problem. Justice Iredell wrote, “It is of infinite moment that Courts of Justice should keep within their proper bounds, and construe, not amend, acts of Legislation.”  The Justices thus blamed Congress for the statutory deficiency and ducked the opportunity to rule on the constitutionality of the Rhode Island statute.

The executor of Farquar’s estate, Alexander Chisholm, sought to collect the debt by filing suit against the state of Georgia in the United States Circuit Court.  Georgia responded that it could not be sued in federal court without its consent.  Acting in his capacity as a circuit court judge, Justice Iredell agreed and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.  The executors of the estate took the case to the United States Supreme Court.  Again, the state of Georgia refused to appear.

Georgia (1793) four justices (Jay, Blair, Wilson, and Cushing) wrote opinions holding that states could be sued in federal court without their consent. This was a controversy that had been festering since the debates at the Constitutional Convention and touched fundamental questions of state sovereignty. The four justices seemed to agree that adoption of the constitution had marked a shift in sovereignty from the previously independent states to the people of the United States. They concluded that, at least for the purposes of the lawsuit, Georgia was not a sovereign entity. Justice Iredell vehemently disagreed.  The opinions written by the four justices in the majority demonstrated a boldness not previously seen in their opinions. They rejected Justice Iredell’s contention that analysis of the legal status of members of various European confederacies provided a guide for interpreting the United Stated States Constitution. Justice Blair, for example, asserted, “The Constitution of the United States is the only fountain from which I shall draw; the only authority to which I shall appeal.” Justice Cushing likewise contended that neither the law of England nor that of any other nation was relevant in interpreting the United States Constitution. Justice Wilson wrote extensively about the meaning of sovereignty under the Constitution and concluded, “I find nothing which tends to evince an exemption of the state of Georgia from the jurisdiction of the court. I find everything to have a contrary tendency.” Chief Justice Jay wrote that Georgia, by being a party to the National Compact, had consented to being sued in federal courts by individual citizens of another State. The Chief Justice argued that extending the judicial power of the United States to controversies in which states were a party was both honest and useful.

It circulated a letter to the other states condemning Chisholm and urging that the Constitution be amended.    The 11th Amendment was introduced into the Senate shortly thereafter and was approved by that body in January 1794.  The House approved the amendment two months later.

United States (1796), the justices ruled for the first time on the constitutionality of an act of Congress. In 1794, Congress had levied a tax on passenger carriages, and the United States sued Daniel Hylton for nonpayment of the tax. Hylton defended on the ground that the carriage tax was a “direct tax” under Article I, section 8, of the Constitution. That section permits Congress to levy direct taxes only if they are apportioned according to population. On appeal, the three justices who heard the case agreed that the carriage tax was an indirect tax and therefore did not violate Article I, section 8. The justices issued their opinions seriatim. Again, there was no opinion of the court.   Hylton was an important case from the perspective of the Supreme Court as an institution, because it revealed that the justices assumed that they had the power to rule on the constitutionality of congressional statutes.  Perhaps the fact that the justices expressed only their individual opinions about the constitutionality of carriage tax made the case seem like a less threatening exercise of judicial power than if the Court had issued just one opinion. Or perhaps the fact that the justices upheld an act of Congress, rather than invalidating it, spared them from attack by Congress.
