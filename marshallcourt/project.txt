Adams hoped to convince John Jay to return to the Supreme Court as Chief Justice. But Jay declined to be re-nominated.    Adams then hinted that he would tap the next senior associate justice, William Paterson, to be the 4th Chief Justice.

He was a Virginia lawyer who had served with distinction in the Revolutionary War, and he had been then General Washington’s chief legal advisor at Valley Forge. Marshall also had been a Virginia legislator and delegate to the Virginia Ratifying Convention, where he spoke persuasively in favor of ratification. His experience in the Revolutionary War had persuaded him of the need for a strong national government. Marshall declined offers to serve in the Washington Administration and, in 1798, he also declined Adams’ offer to nominate him to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy created by James Wilson’s death. However, Marshall did agree to serve as a minister to France in 1797. Then he ran successfully for the House of Representatives in 1799. In June 1800 he reluctantly agreed to become Adams’s Secretary of State. In that capacity, he was in charge of negotiations between the United States’ and France that culminated in the Convention of 1800, ending the undeclared war between the two countries that had threatened to erupt into full-fledged war.

Perhaps Adams already was convinced that Jefferson would win the election of 1800, and he had begun to think of ways to limit Jefferson’s powers. Jefferson never hid his disdain for the Federalist judges who had been put on the bench by Washington and Adams. Jefferson was eager to reshape the judiciary with judges who shared his political views. One way the outgoing Federalists could at least temporarily handcuff Jefferson would be through legislation reducing the size of the Supreme Court from 6 to 5 when the next vacancy arose.      If Congress were to reduce the size of the court, then it would have made little political sense for Adams to elevate a sitting justice into the chief justice’s seat. If Adams appointed Paterson, he would create a vacancy that he probably would not be able to fill before leaving office in March 1801. However, if Adams appointed an outsider, then the Supreme Court would have its full complement of six justices. Jefferson would have to wait through two vacancies before having the opportunity to have an impact on the make-up of the Supreme Court.  The lame-duck Senate confirmed Marshall within a week of his nomination. He took office February 4, 1801, thirteen days before his cousin and political nemesis, Thomas Jefferson, was elected president by the House of Representatives. If Jefferson, not Adams, had picked the nation’s 4th Chief Justice, some scholars believe he probably would have tapped Spencer Roane. Roane was a Virginia judge who was a staunch advocate of states’ rights and a longtime political foe of John Marshall.

He hoped he could convert them from a small band of individual judges into an entity that spoke, whenever possible, with the authoritative voice of a unified court. His first priority was to develop the sense of collegiality and camaraderie that would lead in that direction. He quickly arranged to have all six justices live together at the same boarding house whenever the Court was in session.  That practice continued throughout Marshall’s long tenure, during which time he served with fifteen associate justices. The justices would return to the boarding house after oral argument, where they would discuss cases over meals and in their leisure time. Their discussions often were accompanied by wine, which Marshall had sent to the boarding house each term. Justice Joseph Story wrote to his wife that the justices were such ascetics that they imbibed only when it was raining. He added:   It does sometimes happen that the Chief Justice will say to me when the cloth is removed: “Brother Story, step to the window and see if it does not look like rain.” And If I tell him that the sun is shining, Chief Justice Marshall will sometimes reply: “All the better, for our Jurisdiction extends over so large a territory that the doctrine of chances makes it certain that it must be raining somewhere!”  According to Justice Story, Marshall minimized other social activities when the Court was in session so that the justices could focus on their work. His affable personality and sense of humor, combined with his intellectual tenacity, apparently had their desired effect.

The case involved a merchant ship owned by Hans Frederick Seeman, a German national. Seeman’s ship had been captured on the high seas by the French during the Franco-American conflict of 1798-1800. The ship was recaptured by the USS Constitution, under the command of Captain Silas Talbot. Talbot escorted the ship to a New York harbor and claimed salvage rights over the captured vessel. Seeman challenged the legality of the capture and Talbot’s right to salvage. The case raised several complex legal issues. Nonetheless, on August 11, 1801, only four days after oral argument, the Court issued its opinion. It held that Talbot had the right to salvage the vessel, but it reduced greatly the value of the salvage claim, and it allowed Seeman to deduct his costs from the reduced amount.  Talbot v. Seeman is not a famous cause in Supreme Court history, but it foretold two important developments. The first was the speed with which the Court decided the case. The second was the caption that introduced the decision: “MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.” The tradition of announcing all of the Court’s opinions seriatim was at an end. Talbot ushered in a new era for the Supreme Court.

The “opinion of the Court” approach meant that the third branch, not a variety of individual justices, had put its stamp on the legal outcome in a case. The opinion of the Court approach also allowed the Court to identify the broader legal principles that provided the framework for its decisions. Subsequent cases would be decided in the light of those principles. If the principles were considered no longer sound, then the Court would need to explain its reasoning for abandoning them and explain why it was adopting new or different principles. The accumulation of legal principles in turn created doctrines that served as roadmaps for understanding and predicting how the Court most likely would rule in a particular case. If opinions of the Court were to be unanimous, then the justices would have to engage intellectually with one another. They would need to debate, persuade, and even compromise to achieve a result that satisfied them all. Seriatim opinions did not require such a collegial approach to decision-making.

He filled the four vacant circuit court positions, even as he was planning to work with Congress to abolish the sixteen judgeships that had been created by the Judiciary Act of 1801.   Early in 1802, Kentucky Senator John Breckenridge introduce a bill to repeal the Judiciary Act of 1801. Democratic-Republicans had reasons to be angry at the Federalist Party for trying to expand and pack the federal courts with judges of their choosing. Federalist judges, for example, had willingly enforced the attempts of the Adams Administration to suppress political dissent during the undeclared war with France that had begun in 1798. Thomas Jefferson’s then close political ally, journalist Thomas Callender, was one of those who had been jailed and fined by federal judges under the Sedition Act for criticizing President Adams. Challenges to the Sedition Act never reached the Supreme Court before Congress allowed it to expire, but its enforcement in inferior federal courts seriously blemished the reputations of the judges who served on those courts.

If the justices refused to perform their circuit court duties under the 1802 law, they faced certain impeachment.    Chief Justice Marshall corresponded with his colleagues about what to do. Marshall deferred to their decision, even though he indicated in a letter that he disagreed with it: the justices attended circuit courts in 1802.

Maryland in 1819 provided proof that the Supreme Court had developed an institutional identity separate from the political preferences of the presidents who had appointed the justices. In this case, the Court unanimously gave a distinctly pro-nationalist interpretation of the nature of the union, the powers of Congress, and constitutional limitations on the states.  McCulloch addressed fundamental questions about the Constitution, Congress’s power under the Necessary and Proper Clause, and the relationship between the national government and the states. The uproar the decision generated was a clear indication that the country did not share a common vision about the nature of the Constitution or how ambiguous provisions in it should be interpreted. Marshall had ruled that the Constitution emanates from the people, thereby rejecting the compact theory that it is a creature of the states. Marshall also had construed the Necessary and Proper Clause in a manner that gives Congress latitude to legislate on myriad matters not explicitly identified in Article I, Section 8. Finally, Marshall had held that the United States Constitution limits the range of policy options available to state legislatures. This was an unpopular message to states that persisted in believing that their legislatures were constrained only by limitations in their own state constitutions.

They had a copy of the opinion printed in the leading Richmond newspaper so that the ruling could be “controverted and exposed.” For the next three months, they published essays criticizing Marshall’s reasoning in the case. Marshall was incensed. He wrote a series of essays under the pen name “A Friend to the Union” in the Philadelphia Union newspaper defending the decision. Spencer Roane entered the fray in June, writing under the pen name Hampden, refuting Marshall’s arguments. He declared McCulloch to be the “Alpha and Omega” of federal usurpations of state sovereignty.   The controversy over McCulloch helped to shape political responses to issues looming on the horizon, including the debate over slavery. The Supreme Court would continue to play a central role in those debates, thanks in large part to the institutional identity it had developed under the leadership of John Marshall.

In all instances, the Court upheld congressional statutes in the face of challenges to their constitutionality. The decisions also tilted power in the direction of the national government and limited the powers of the states. In unanimous or nearly unanimous decisions, the Court:  Established the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction over decisions of state courts (Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, 1816) Struck down state laws that impaired the obligation of contracts (Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 1819) Established national supremacy over bankruptcy laws  (Sturges v. Crowninshield, 1819) Upheld the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce (Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824)   In these decisions, and in the course of deciding other specific cases, the Court interpreted ambiguous constitutional provisions and made far-reaching statements about constitutional principles. As will become clear, however, the Court’s decisions did not put to rest still unresolved controversies about the nature of the union, the respective powers of the three branches of the national government, or the relationship between the national government and the states.
